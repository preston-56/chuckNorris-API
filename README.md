# Chuck Norris Jokes
- The project is divided into two parts. One aims to fetch data from an external API while the other seeks to add some sort of interactivity to it by fetching data from the local host. Therefore, it's user-friendly. 
- On the second part which I have as, `Random CRUD Jokes`  the user is able to `create`, `read`, `update`, and as well `delete` data from the local host server.This is achieved by using the `HTTP` request methods.
- The `script.js` file fetches data from the external `https://api.chucknorris.io/` Chuck Norris API and then randomly displays  `Chuck Norris Jokes`. 
- The user is able to generate a random joke based on the category he selects. Before making any selection, the user is also able to generate a random joke which is not based on any category.
- To play with the application, clone or download the repository then at the project directory run the following command `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies that will enable the application to automatically.
